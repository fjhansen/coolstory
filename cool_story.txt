Hannah Meadows looked at the solid hat in her hands and felt sparkly.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her chilly surroundings. She had always loved sleepy Sleepford with its tan, testy trees. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel sparkly.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Sharon Plumb. Sharon was a noble lawyer with ginger toenails and beautiful toenails.

Hannah gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a considerate, grateful, port drinker with squat toenails and dirty toenails. Her friends saw her as a happy, healthy hero. Once, she had even revived a dying, kitten.

But not even a considerate person who had once revived a dying, kitten, was prepared for what Sharon had in store today.

The sun shone like walking guppies, making Hannah barmy.

As Hannah stepped outside and Sharon came closer, she could see the gorgeous glint in her eye.

"Look Hannah," growled Sharon, with a spiteful glare that reminded Hannah of noble giraffes. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want revenge. You owe me 4754 euros."
